# Graph Autoencoder for Molecular Link Reconstruction and Prediction

This repository contains the implementation and experiments of Graph Autoencoder models to reconstruct and predict molecular interactions within the OmniPath network, a database representing molecular interactions.

## Overview
Understanding molecular relationships (e.g., between genes, proteins, and other molecules) is critical for tasks like:

- Identifying biological pathways
- Predicting disease associations
- Supporting drug discovery

The goal of this project is to:
- Develop and optimize Graph Autoencoder architectures to learn meaningful representations of the molecular interaction network.
- Reconstruct the OmniPath graph and evaluate the recovery of its network connections.
- Explore the potential of predicting new molecular interactions that might have important biological significance but are currently missing from the database.

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks for streamlined experimentation.
